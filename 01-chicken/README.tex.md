# Chicken problem

## Description

The prices for different kinds of chicken:

- cock - 5

## Procedure

Denote the number of cocks is `nCock`, the number of hens is `nHen`, and the number of chicken is `nChick`.

The mathematical model for this question is

nCock + nHen + nChick = 100 \\
5*nCock + 3*nHen + 1*nChick = 100
\end{cases}
